# Data-Analysis-on-Air-quality
For this project I first downloaded the dataset from Kaggle & also an image which states certain information such as Daily AQI Color, Levels of concern, Value of Index & PM (particulate matter). Then with the help of Python and some of its libraries and framework, I understood the data and prepared it for  exploratory data analysis. I also answered some of the relevant questions with the help of data visualization.
This is the chart which I used for reference:-
